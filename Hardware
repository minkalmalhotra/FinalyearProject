THE TWO WAY MIRROR - is assembled in the frame, thenm adding the strip of wood at the bottom of the frame to support.
MONITOR- which is installed at the back of the mirror and a keyboard with mouse.
RASPBERRY PI WITH SD-CARD- in the computer. Download Rasbian from raspberrypi.org/downloads. When the ZIP-file is extracted you need Win32 Disk Imager. You can download it at sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/. Install and start it. Klick on the folder icon and browse to the folder where you have the Raspbian files. Make sure that the destination is the SD-card (in my case D:)
When the write is successful, you just take the SD-card and put it in your Raspberry Pi. Connect to the laptop.
In my case, I came directly to the desktop on start. To make the right configurations you need to open the terminal and enter "sudo raspi-config".
Desktop  GUI with the "pi" user.
HDMI TO VGA CONVERTOR- from raspberry pi to monitor using VGA CABLE
